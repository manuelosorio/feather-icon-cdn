# Feather Icons CDN

[Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/) is a collection I frequently use across my projects. When working on a project that didnâ€™t support npm, I needed a simple way to include icons without manual downloads. This Express app serves Feather Icons, making them easy to use in any project via a direct URL.
